# write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns a boolean 
# representing whether the array is monotonic

# an array is said to be monotonic if it's elements, from left to right, are
# entirely non-increasing or entirely non-decreasing

array = [-1, -5, -10, -1100, -1101, -1102, -9001]
